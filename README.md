# Angle-vectors
Allows you to find the angle and other things of two vectors in an orthonormal frame via their norm, or you can find it with only 2 coordinates
It calculates
- The length of 2 vectors
- The Scalar product
- The angle between these vectors in degree and radiant

# How to use
Everything is explained in the file but here is a summary:

1) Replace the 3 objects in the V1 and V2's arrays by \[true: the norms of your vectors] or \[false: the coordinate of 2 points in your orthonormal frame]
2) Choose (true/false) if what you put above are norms or coordinate ^
3) Run the program and check the console
